# NAME
#    pwd2url - convert Unix pwd to URL for /courses/ hierarchy
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    pwd2url
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    Converts an /afs/ Linux pwd to a URL in the
#    /afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses/ hierarchy.
#    ITS policy is to export a subdirectory public_html to
#    the web.  It is assumed that in any immediate subdirectory
#    of a course, in public_html, there is a symlink : -> ..
#    to make the entire hierarchy visible to the web.
#

$coursepwd = "/afs/cats.ucsc.edu/courses";
$courseurl = "https://www2.ucsc.edu/courses";

$pwd = $ENV{PWD} || qx(pwd);
chomp $pwd;

print "No URL for $pwd\n" and exit
      unless $pwd =~ m|^$coursepwd/([^/]*)(/(.*))?|;
($course, $subdir) = ($1, $2);
print "$courseurl/$course/:$subdir/\n";
